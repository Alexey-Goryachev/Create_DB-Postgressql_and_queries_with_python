# Create_DB-Postgressql_and_queries_with_python
1. Create a database, use the create_tables.py file (after running the container with Postgresql).
2.Fill the database with data, use the file insert_data.py.
3. We use files from the py_query_files folder, execute queries.

p.s. As an option, you can restore an already prepared database with data from the dump_postgres_db file and immediately run queries against it.
